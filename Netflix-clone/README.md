# Netflix Homepage Clone

This project, which serves as my introduction to the world of web dev, is a clone of the Netflix homepage, created with HTML and CSS. 
It was a front-end development exercise aimed at replicating the visual design and layout of the Netflix website, hoping to understand and play with the visual appeal to the end users.
