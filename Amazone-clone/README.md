# Amazon Homepage Clone

This project is a simple clone of the Amazon homepage, created using HTML and CSS coded from scratch. 
This project helped enhance front-end development skills by replicating the Amazon homepage, providing hands-on experience in structuring web pages, styling elements, and achieving a responsive design. 
Tackling the challenges of mimicking a widely-utilized page helped my understanding of modern web development techniques and how improve proficiency in crafting visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.
